# Notes

Hey,

I'm using this to help you get a better understanding of my thought process
Also, I may leave extra notes and commented out code than I normally would to
help you get a better understanding of my thought process

## plan

Components I think I'll need:

```md
App - welcome the user
 |
 |- Quiz - handles logic for a quiz
     |
     |- Question - handles logic for single question
     |     |- Form 
     |     
     |- Results - shows results and sends user back to a new/refreshed quiz
```
